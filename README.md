## ðŸš² Case Study: Bike Sharing Program In Chicago 
Capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. The program prepares participants for a career in data analytics.


### Overview
The project explores how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bike sharing program differently, drawing insights from which to facilitate the marketing strategies to convert casual riders to members. 

Cyclistic launched a bike-share program in 2016, in Chicago. It has since grown to a fleet of 5,824 geo-tracked bicycles and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.


### Summary of Findings
- Member users use the bike-sharing system for commuting purposes. The average ride length is around 10-15 minutes.
- Among casual users, a fraction use the bike-sharing system for leisure while a fraction use the system for daily commutes.
- Unlike member users, casual-user commuters have a longer average ride length, around 22-25 minutes using classic bikes, and around 15 minutes using electric bikes.

### Key Insight
By investigating the usage patterns between casual and member users, I found similarities in usage patterns during weekday rush hour between a fraction of causal users and member users. Around the same time of the day, casual users however have a longer average ride length, suggesting that they live farther than their member counterparts. Given this observation, I propose experimenting with an electric bike membership targeted at casual users to encourage their conversion to member users.
