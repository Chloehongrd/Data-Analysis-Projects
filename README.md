## Case Study: Bike Sharing Program In Chicago 
Capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. The program prepares participants for a career in data analytics.


### Overview
The project explores how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bike sharing program differently in order to facilitate the marketing strategies that aim to convert casual riders to members. 

Cyclistic launched a bike-share program in 2016, Chicago. It has since grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geo-tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.


### Summary of Findings
- Member users uses the bike share system for commuting purposes. The average ride length is around 10-15 minutes.
- A subset of casual riders uses the bike share system as a daily commuter.
- Unlike member users, casual-user commuters has a longer average ride length, around 22-25 minutes using classic bikes, and around 15 minutes using electric bikes.

### Key Insight
Casual users include both tourists and residents, as suggested by higher weekend ride numbers, indicating leisure activities. However, their weekday usage patterns resemble those of member users who primarily use the program for commuting. Specifically, the average ride times during weekday rush hours for this group of casual users are about 40 minutes for classic bikes and 15 minutes for electric bikes. This suggests that some casual users also commute but live farther than their member counterparts. Given this observation, I propose experimenting with an electric bike membership targeted at casual users to encourage their conversion to member users.
