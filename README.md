## ðŸš² Case Study: Bike Sharing Program In Chicago 
Capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. The program prepares participants for a career in data analytics.


#### Overview:
This project explores the differences in usage patterns between annual members and casual riders of the Cyclistic bike-sharing program. The goal is to derive insights that can inform marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into members.


#### Context 
Cyclistic, launched in 2016 in Chicago, operates a bike-share program with a fleet of 5,824 geo-tracked bicycles available at 692 stations across the city. Users can unlock bikes from one station and return them to any other station within the system at any time.

#### Summary of Findings
- Members: Primarily use the bike-sharing system for commuting, with an average ride length of 10-15 minutes.
- Casual Riders: Consist of two main groups
  - Leisure users.
  - Commuters, who have longer average ride lengths compared to members:
     - Classic bikes: 22-25 minutes.
     - Electric bikes: around 15 minutes.



### Key Insight
A fraction of casual users show similar usage patterns to members during weekday rush hours, but with longer ride durations, indicating they live farther away. Based on this observation, I recommend experimenting with an electric bike membership specifically designed for casual users. This strategy could encourage casual riders to become members by offering a more convenient and time-efficient commuting option.
